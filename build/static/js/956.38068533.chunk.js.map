I am currently based out of the\n            Houston, Texas area. Earlier this year, I made the decision to shift\n            my career path and pursue web development. Prior to making that\n            change, my professional career was in the Oil and Gas indusrty.\n            Throughout my experience I was exposed to technology that sparked an\n            interest in web development. I realized the enjoyment in creating\n            applications using methods learned in operations. Moving forward\n            with my new found passion, I aspire to collaborate on a team that\n            sharpens my skills and encourages growth. In my free time I enjoy\n            traveling, camping, hiking and staying physically active playing\n            sports.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"contactDiv\">\n          <h2>Contact Information</h2>\n          <p>Matthew Castoreno</p>\n          <p>Houston, Texas</p>\n          <p>matthew.castoreno@yahoo.com</p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </Container>\n  );\n}\n\nconst Container = styled.div`\n  display: flex;\n  justify-content: center;\n  background-color: white;\n  height: 100vh;\n  .aboutSection {\n    display: flex;\n    flex-direction: column;\n    justify-content: center;\n    width: 80%;\n    padding-top: 60px;\n  }\n`;\n"],"names":["About","Container","id","className","styled"],"sourceRoot":""}
