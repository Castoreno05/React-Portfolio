Enter a city name in the search bar and the application will make an API call to retrieve, then append live data onto the home page. The data consists of: tempurature, wind speed, humidity, and UV index for the current and five day forecast. Once a search has been made the application saves the city in local strorage. Doing this allows the user to generate another API call to get live results of the weather.",
