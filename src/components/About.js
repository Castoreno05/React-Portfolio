          <p>
            Hello, my name is Matthew Castoreno. I am currently based out of the
            Houston, Texas area. Earlier this year, I made the decision to shift
            my career path and pursue web development. Prior to making that
            change, my professional career was in the Oil and Gas indusrty.
            Throughout my experience I was exposed to technology that sparked an
            interest in web development. I realized the enjoyment in creating
            applications using methods learned in operations. Moving forward
            with my new found passion, I aspire to collaborate on a team that
            sharpens my skills and encourages growth. In my free time I enjoy
            traveling, camping, hiking and staying physically active playing
            sports.
